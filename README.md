# FoodmineProject

A simple Angular project built as part of my learning journey. The app focuses on displaying food-related information using basic Angular features such as routing and standalone components.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a foundational understanding of Angular, including how to set up and structure a project, configure routes for navigation, bootstrap an Angular application, and work with standalone components. It was a great introduction to building modular, navigable single-page applications.

## Features

- View all available foods in the restaurant
- Visit individual food pages with detailed views
- Search through the food list
- Categorize the foods, and navigate based on those categories
- Seamless navigation using Angular's built-in routing
